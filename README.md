# Magic the Gathering mana ratio calculator

A simple calculator for finding a base number of each type of land to put in your deck. 

When I was building decks in Magic the Gathering, I would guess the amount of colored lands to put in my decks. Beats calculating a ratio by hand, and I would still guess over spend even a second doing fraction math. Hence, this app  

This app is for calculating the ratio of different colors of mana in your Magic The Gathering deck.  

Use is simple, enter the number of colored symbols on your cards, and the number of lands contributing to your mana pool for each color appears on the table. 

This means that you are welcome to configure it such that your average card cost is 100000, or something,  but you only have 36 cards in your deck, the calculator will still only reccomend 24 lands. (We're trusting that you know how to build decks, just that you don't want to waste time doing arithmetic).
